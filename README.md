# React-Box-Color

##Overview

#this.setState() Review

A component can do more than just read its own state.
A component can also change its own state.
The method will update our state and then call the render() method to re-render the page.
Takes two arguments: an object that will update the component's state, and a callback. You basically never need the callback.
 

##Objective

Create a <div> box with an onClick handle event that changes the background color when clicked. 
When the box is clicked, we want a clickCounter indicating how many times it was clicked. 
We want the box color to toggle back to it's original color! (Hint: create a toggle function)

Before reaching step 3, make sure to create a GitHub repository called `React Box Color`  and add/commit what you currently have. 
 

#Do you accept a challenge?

Randomize the color that will appear for every box click and make sure the clickCounter is incrementing properly!

##Getting started

Create a react-app named boxcolor
Start your react application
Clean App.js and App.css file
Update functional component to a class component (App.js)
Set a state (hint: color & clickCounter)
When the button is clicked it should change its color and the counter should increase.
Use a component lifecycle method to call setState.
 

##Requirements

Pseudocode for things we both covered in class and your toggle functionality
Must add CSS
Must add a font from Google Fonts (Links to an external site.)
